This is the processing pipeline that was used in generating the [Avocado Research Email
Collection](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2015T03). 



The Avocado Research Email Collection is a corpus of emails and attachments (2 million items),
distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium for use in research and development in e-discovery,
social network analysis, and related fields. The emails and attachments come from 282 accounts of a
defunct information technology company referred to as "Avocado". The collection consists of the
processed personal folders (PST files) of these accounts with metadata describing folder structure,
email characteristics and contacts, among others. It is expected to be useful for social network
analysis, e-discovery and related fields.


This code handled the following data processing tasks:
1. PST file extraction (initial data set: 282 PST source files, 66GB)
1. File deduplication
1. Email thread reconstruction
1. MIME-type identification
1. Archive extraction
1. Text extraction
1. Partial redaction of sensitive data
1. Generation of the distribution data files

The code includes a web-based system to visually explore the collection's data and its
relationships, create labeled subsets of the data, and generate custom distribution sets based on
selected criteria (attachment MIME types, file extensions, PST item types).

Why *Pluto*? Because, similar to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto_(mythology)">Pluto</a>, the system "presided over" the
afterlife of email.

## Usage

**To extract data:**
* The system requires Python 2.x, Java and MySQL (no specific version requirements)
* You must have libpst installed (see [http://www.five-ten-sg.com/libpst](http://www.five-ten-sg.com/libpst)); libpst requires boost and libgsf  
  Make sure to edit your PYTHONPATH:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages
export PYTHONPATH
```
* Create a file `config.properties`, preferably outside your source code directory (see
  [`config-SAMPLE.properties`](config-SAMPLE.properties) as an example; the file must be formatted
  with no spaces around '=').  
* Create a symbolic link to `config.properties` in the root and python/ directories
* Run the [`util/run_full_index.sh`](util/run_full_index.sh) from the root directory:
```
$ ./util/run_full_index.sh
```
If you are processing a large data set on a remote server, it might be a good idea to run the
process in the background the HUP (hangup) signal to prevent the process from dying when you are logged
out:
```
$ nohup ./util/run_full_index.sh &
```
* If you need to recompile the Java files, you may need to include the -sourcepath and -classpath
  options. For example:
```basj
$ javac -d pluto/bin -sourcepath pluto/ -cp $CLASSPATH:/<path-to-tika-app.jar> pluto/TikaExtractor.java
```

**To generate distribution files:**
* Edit the file [`main.py`](python/main.py) to specify the output directory and the distro builder
  (builder1 or builder2)
* Run python/main.py:
```
$ python main.py
```


**To setup the web-based system:**
  * Create a file `config.ini`, preferably outside your source code directory (see [`php/config-SAMPLE.ini`](php/config-SAMPLE.ini) as an example)
  * Create a symbolic link to `config.ini` in the [`php/`](php/) directory
  * Point your web server to the [`webapp`](php/webapp/) directory, which is your root web directory

**Disclaimer:**

1. This code's only purpose was to generate the Avocado Research Email Collection. It has not been
   systematically tested on other PST data sets. 
2. The code may have been slightly modified before generating the final published version of the
   data. For example, the metadata format generated by
   [`python/distro/builder1.py`](python/distro/builder1.py) was not used for the final distribution
   (it did not combine custodian items in a single XML file and instead used <xi:include> directives
   that referenced individual item files).  See 
   [`python/distro/builder2.py`](python/distro/builder2.py) for the alternative format.
